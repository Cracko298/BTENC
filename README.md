# BTENC
- A custom encryption algorithm with variable key length support, that works differently from something like XOR Ciphers.

# Usage: 
```
py cli.py [MODE] [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE] [KEY]
  [MODE]        = Decrypt/Encrypt.
  [INPUT_FILE]  = Input File PATH.
  [OUTPUT_FILE] = Output File PATH.
  [KEY]         = Your Custom Key.
```
